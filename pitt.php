<div id="text"><p>"The first time i ever came here I past it so many times by the time I found it it was closed. I love cooking and experimenting with food, London’s great for that. Usually apart from the sides every time you come here there’s a different main. You never know what you’re going to get, and also, I mean the place is hidden, it’s not obvious what it is, I mean the curtains in the window, why are they even there? They don’t make any sense it’s meant to be a restaurant and surely you’d want to promote yourself, but it’s hidden and that’s what I like. You can’t book a table, in fact sometimes the queue goes down past a few shops. Even though there is an air of pretentiousness about the whole thing…the eating is good. It’s good eating! If I had the funds I would come here everyday, It’s an amazing place, restaurants have become a bit pretentious these days. They do amazing cocktails too, but I don’t drink them…I stick to whiskey."</p></div>
