<div id="text"><p>"It's a hub of history, culture and creativity. Which I think really represents some of the best things about such a metropolitan city.Â Growing up in such a mutli-cultural and creative family it's always been important to have places like the V&A where I can learn more about cultural history and enjoy creative workshops. Even the building it's self has so much art and history within it's walls.</p><p>When you enter the main hall the glass structure/sculpture is absolutely breath taking. Which starts off all the excitement of what I am going to see and learn this time round. One of the main things I love at the V&A is their exhibitions. They always use a large and varied space and each one is so different. My favourite of all are the fashion exhibitions as this is my biggest love and passion."</p></div>
