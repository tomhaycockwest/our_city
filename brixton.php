<div id="text"><p>"I spent countless days many that even I can't recollect here Leant back in my buggy watching my Dads intensely religious, rigorous training. As me and my siblings grew we were soon inheriting, somewhat forcefully these same rigorous training efforts, always rewarded with a pattie and cool aid. As we grew further Brixton became the nucleus of many of my first struggles as a young, more specifically a young black man growing in and through a particular experience in such an intense environment. Why this all defines London somewhat to me, as can we? Is because as we wander through the social, emotional, cultural and even structural maze that is London, it for me has grown into a symbol of defiance, an expression of our innate human nature. Like the early memories of watching my pops defy what were profound odds in the gym to watching the community do the same by sheer existence, especially growing up on the stories and overheard and heated conversations outside 'Reds Records' amongst my Father and other London Born 'Black' men and women, of the many fights fought to preserve and expand an identity specific to them like so many others who sailed ships of adverse origin and destination."</p></div>
